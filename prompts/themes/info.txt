Informational / Educational,
Select segments that are:
- **Fact-driven or instructional** (neutral/“neu” or mildly “pos” sentiment).  
- Focus on **knowledge transfer**—definitions, “how-to” steps, scientific or cultural facts, life hacks.  
- Dialogue where one speaker explains and one listens (use speaker IDs to maintain clarity).  
- Exclude purely emotional or comedic tangents—stick to content that teaches or informs.  
- Build a mini-story that functions like a quick lesson or tutorial, progressing logically from introduction → detail → conclusion.
