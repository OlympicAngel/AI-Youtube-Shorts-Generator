Emotional / Motivational / Love,
Select segments that are:
- **Emotional or motivational** (sentiments swing from “pos” to “neg” or vice versa to build drama).  
- Include **heartwarming or heartbreaking narratives** (romance, betrayal, friendship).  
- Scenes where a speaker expresses vulnerability, hope, or inspiration—especially if another speaker responds.  
- Emphasize dialogues with contrasting sentiment tags (e.g., a “neg” moment followed by a “pos” uplift).  
- Build a mini-story that takes the viewer on an emotional journey (e.g., sadness → realization → hope).
