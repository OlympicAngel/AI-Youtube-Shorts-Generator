Funny / Light / Comedy,
Select segments that match the tone and are part of the same core:
- **Humorous or comedic** (positive sentiment, playful banter, dark humor, “funny-dialogs” between speakers).  
- Emphasize **lighthearted trolls, silly, pranks, comedy bits**, or any “hilarious moments.”  
- Prefer segments where speakers show positive sentiment (“pos”), or even slightly “neu” if it leads into/comes out of a comedic payoff.  
- Use speaker IDs to capture witty back-and-forth exchanges.  
- Aim for a mini-story arc that builds up to a punchline or a comedic revelation.
