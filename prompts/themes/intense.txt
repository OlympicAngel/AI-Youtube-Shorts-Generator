Intense / Action / Thriller,
Select segments that are:
- **High-energy or suspenseful** (mostly “neg” or “neu” evolving into “pos” if there’s a resolution).  
- Focus on **dramatic moments, shocking reveals, or conflict**.  
- Scenes where speaker sentiment is tense—arguments, urgent exclamations, or cliffhangers.  
- Emphasize fast pacing: short bursts of speech, abrupt transitions, or exclamatory dialogue.  
- Build a mini-story that conveys a sense of danger or urgency, culminating in a dramatic peak or twist.
