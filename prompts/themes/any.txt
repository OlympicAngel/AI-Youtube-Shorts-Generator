Wildcard / Attention-Seeker,
Select segments that match the tone and are part of the same core:
- **Any combination** of comedy, drama, thrill, or education—optimized purely to grab and hold attention.  
- Look for the **most emotionally charged moments** (whether “pos” or “neg”) and/or the funniest lines.  
- You can mix speaker dialogues of different sentiments as long as each chosen segment **contributes** to an attention-grabbing arc.  
- Emphasize variety (e.g., a funny quip followed by a dramatic reveal followed by an informative nugget).  
- Build a mini-story that feels unpredictable—viewers shouldn’t know what’s coming next, but each segment still belongs to a single “meta-story” or captivating thread.
