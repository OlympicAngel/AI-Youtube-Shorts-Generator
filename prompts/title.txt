video.

The title must:
- Be super catchy and natural.
- Use hot words or slang when relevant.
- Hint at humor, drama, surprise, or pop culture.
- Be under 70 characters.

Important:
- Focus on the vibe, not exact words.
- You may use emoji (minimallyand strictly optional).
- Use natuaral language, as if human whould thing of it.
- Use the same language as the transcript content.
- Your output should be a single title, no explanation.
